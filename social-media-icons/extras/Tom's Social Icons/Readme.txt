Have a gander...
-------------------------------------------------/

Thanks for downloading these neat social bookmark icons.
Just a few side notes before you get you going.

-> These icons are not optimized for web design. Given that you have Photoshop I highly recommend re-saving
   the icons using 'Save for Web & Devices'.
   Although I've already done this. I've used maximum quality (PNG-24) and the file sizes can be quite large.
   
   If you're using the icons on a solid background I recommend saving the icon as a PNG-8 (pick a nice balance
   between quality and size) WITH the background colour of the container they are in.
   By doing this you'll be able to get the file size down to a few hundred bytes (good for loading speed).

   Of course you could use them as is. That's just a recommendation.


-> Why include greyscale styles?
   I've included greyscale styles for those neat hover effects. Use the greyscale icons and CSS3 transitions
   (or jQuery if you're awkward) to animate into a colour icon on mouse over. Have a Google!

-> Yes these icons are free and will always remain free whether you're using them for personal or commercial 
   use - I don't mind.
